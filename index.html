<p>剛完成了一個六小時的教學，重要的是使用了製作中的自學平台，目標是將這個平台套用內容後放到 Mac App Store 及 iPad 上賣，再考慮放到 Web 上。

<p>用左 Things 兩三年，今日遇到一個都係 GTD 既 tasks management client. 其中一個令我一看就愛上既 &quot;Organize&quot; 畫面，用一張張卡既形式將 Today, Tomorrow, Next 等列出。由於 MacHeist 附贈 Mac 版，就順道買埋 iPad 及 iPhone 版。試一試係咪俾 Things 好用，遲d係呢度 update 一下試用感想。

        <section class="content"><p>My problem for long time is <em>focus</em>. I have been having too many things happening at the same time.

</p>
<p>Last night I read an email article named <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2012/10/15/focus-not-effort/">Why focus (not effort) is the key to getting stuff done</a>. I wanna share the most important part of them here.

</p>
<p><strong>The one sentence to remember if you leave this page now.</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being more focused is easy: stop having so many damn goals.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Only have one goal at a time.</strong>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This doesn&apos;t mean you must devote your life obsessively to only one end. All it means is that if you&apos;re going to have goals at all, put one as the focus and let the others be optional, for a dedicated period of time.

</p>
<p>What if you have two goals that are both really important to you? Well then let one be your focus for this month and let the other be your focus for the next.

</p>
<p>Having a goal doesn&apos;t mean everything else in your life is completely ignored. I still went to the gym, wrote blog articles, met new people and paid my taxes during the MIT Challenge. The difference was that I knew they weren&apos;t my focus, so my job was only to try to keep them running smoothly.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>And the action step to get focus now!</strong>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The action steps to start using this to accomplish more are quite simple:


</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide what is your focus right now. There can only be one.</li>
<li>Commit to keeping it as your focus until a certain time. It might be a deadline for a project, as it was with my challenge, or it might be arbitrary. Focus doesn&apos;t work if it switches too rapidly.</li>
<li>Everything other than your focus, the aim is to keep it running smoothly, but no active self-improvement and absolutely no new voluntary commitments.
If your goal is a small one, make the commitment period shorter. If you have two major goals, flip a coin and commit to the first one for the next month and the second for the month after.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your project is long-term, make it a focus in the beginning until you think you can continue it successfully with it being a non-focus. My business was a focus for the first few years, but during the MIT Challenge it became a non-focus. That didn&apos;t mean I stopped blogging (indeed, I maintained two blogs during that time), but that I only sustained output.



</p>
<p>For many people these action steps won&apos;t be enough. Their existing load of commitments is so vast that they are already overextended. Merely trying to keep all of these activities as non-focuses will still leave them burned out.

</p>
<p>If you&apos;re in this situation, phase out your existing commitments over time. Eventually, you can get to a state where you could meaningfully focus on one goal in particular.
