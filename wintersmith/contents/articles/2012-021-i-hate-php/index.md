In the past year, I keep using both PHP and Ruby on Rails in my projects. Everytime I got to write PHP code, I hate it. I hate it especially because I keep repeating myself in PHP, with those dump code.

Yes, you can still write non-repeating and elegant code in PHP. But the point is that the environment doesn't encourage this to happen. In contract, RoR encourages programmers to write less code on common pattern.

In conclusion, I am now a fan of the following philosophy, 

__"A happy programmer is a productive programmer"__

And PHP doesn’t make me happy at all. period.
